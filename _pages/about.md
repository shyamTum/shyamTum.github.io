## Short bio

I am a **PhD Candidate in Computer Science** focused on **AI for biomedical imaging** and **computational pathology**.  
My research spans **multimodal ML**, **agentic AI (LLM/VLM + retrieval)**, and **generative diffusion models** for robust learning and reasoning.

## What I’m optimizing for (dual-purpose)

- **Industry AI Research Scientist:** strong evidence of impact, reproducibility, scalable engineering, clear metrics, demos/code.
- **Academia / Tenure-track:** clear research narrative, publications, talks, mentorship/teaching, and long-term vision.

## Core skills

- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, Transformers, diffusion models, segmentation/classification
- **Foundation models:** VLM embeddings, LLM tool use, RAG pipelines
- **ML + Stats:** classical ML baselines, ablations, uncertainty, evaluation rigor
- **Infra:** HPC training, DDP, experiment tracking, reproducibility
