## Research themes

### 1) Agentic AI for biomedical imaging
I build systems that **combine specialist models** (e.g., CNN/ViT/ML heads) with **LLM/VLM-based arbitration** and **evidence grounding** (RAG/tooling) to improve reliability and interpretability.

**Keywords:** multi-agent, arbitration, reliability, uncertainty, evidence grounding, clinical decision support.

---

### 2) Multimodal learning (image + metadata + text)
I study how to fuse imaging representations with structured clinical/biological metadata and text to improve prediction and discovery.

**Keywords:** multimodal fusion, MIL/WSI, VLM embeddings, biomarker discovery, representation learning.

---

### 3) Generative diffusion for computational pathology
I develop diffusion-based synthesis/inpainting pipelines to create high-quality data and study how generative augmentation affects downstream performance and robustness.

**Keywords:** diffusion, synthesis, augmentation, FID/KID, downstream segmentation/classification.

---

### 4) Scalable evaluation and reproducibility
I focus on high-quality experimental design: ablations, consistent protocols, and repeatable training/evaluation pipelines that transfer well across datasets.

## Collaboration
I’m open to collaborations on:
- agentic AI for imaging (tool-using LLMs / VLMs / RAG)
- foundation model evaluation for WSI/microscopy
- diffusion-based synthesis for rare/low-data pathology tasks
